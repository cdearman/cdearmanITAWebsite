<h2>Purpose of this file group</h2>
	<p>When considering this assignment, I thought about how I would want to submit it. Rather than trying to submit several individual files, I decided to try and submit everything through one GitHub repo. We'll see if I'm able to do it.</p>
<h3>Future of this file group</h3>
	<p>Here, I'll be able to return to my own collection of files, and add functionality as I go through the program. I might even be able to practice future implementation here, or use it as a refresher for future problems.</p>
